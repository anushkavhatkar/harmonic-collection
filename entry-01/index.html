<p class="bodytext"> Colour has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. I didn't quite understand how 
  it worked when I was much younger. It definitely felt like magic in a lot of ways. Having understood how 
  it works now, it still feels like magic. My harmonic collection is an ode to everything that thrills me about colour. 
  It is a journey into learning and designing information just as I learn to write and interpret code.

  So let's start with something mildly boring:

<p class="bodytext"> 
  <ul class="bodytext">
   <li>If I told my younger self this wave completes 1 oscillation in 3 seconds, 7-year-old me 
    <i>might</i> be able to tell its frequency is 0.33.</li>
    <br><li>And if light is a wave, then it must have a frequency. It does.</li>
  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turns out we already have a name for the frequency of light: <i>color.</i>
  <br><br><li>Color, really, seems to be nothing more than a measure of how quickly the light waves are waving</li>
    <li>If our eyes were quick enough, we would've been able to see observe this periodic motion <i>(just like we can see this wave!).</i></li>
    <li>The frequency of the light we see is so high, we cannot possibly see it as a wave. It waves up and down more than 400 million <i>million</i> times a second.</li>
    <li>But you're secretly a data-processor: you can tell by looking at the color of a light wave what its frequency is.</li>
    <li>The lowest frequency light-wave we can see is red, and the highest frequency is violet.</li>
    <br>
    And in between, all the other frequencies form a continuous band of color called the <i>visible spectrum.</i> 
    </p></ul>

<p class="bodytext">
Say you have a yellow coloured object sitting on your desk. The sun emits all colors (all frequencies!)
of light, so light of all colors is hitting this object. It <i>appears</i> yellow because it reflects yellow light 
more than any other colour. <i>What about blue, purple, and red light waves?</i> &nbsp; They are absorbed, and 
their energy is converted to heat.<br>

<br> So in a way, the color we perceive an object to be is precisely the object it <i>isn't.</i></p>
