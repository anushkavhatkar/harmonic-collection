      <p>Colours are beautiful. Some of the most brilliant colours throughout history have been some of the deadliest. Here’s some of them. 
        <br><br>In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered radium. Claimed to have restorative properties, it was added to toothpaste, medicine, water, and food. It was the most luminous, glowing green. We started using it in beauty products and cosmetics. It wasn’t until the mid-20th century that we realized radium’s harmful effects as a radioactive element outweighed its remarkable visual benefits. </p></div>

    <p> Lead white was the only practical choice for white oil or tempera paint, until the 19th century. To make paint, artists used to grind a block of lead into powder. And as far back as the 4th century BCE, the Greeks knew how to treat lead to make it the cogent pigment we know. However, this exposes highly toxic dust particles. In humans, lead is directly absorbed into the body and distributed to the body, soft tissues, and mineralized tissues. And once in the nervous system, it caused damages ranging from learning disabilities to blood pressure damages. This didn’t stop the practice of using this toxic pigment across times and cultures, though. Its glow, opacity, density and warm tone could not be matched. It was irresistible to Vermeer and the Impressionists, even when painters who used it complained of palsies, melancholy, coughing, enlarged retinas, and even blindness. It was widely used until it was banned in the 1970s. </p></div>
