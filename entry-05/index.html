        <br><br>Until the mid-1800s, all dyes came from natural sources, such as insects, roots, or minerals. Producing them was difficult and expensive.</p></div>

       <div> <p>Sea snails like these are found around the world. When poked (milked) or crushed, they secrete a substance that was used for making purple dye as early as 1570 BC. Thousands of snails were needed to color a single robe, and for centuries purple dye was more valuable than silver and worn only by royalty.</p></div>

        <div><p>Mixtec weavers in Oaxaca, Mexico, color locally grown cotton with natural dyes — including the rare purple tixinda, extracted from the Plicopurpura pansa mollusk. The introduction of synthetic dyes and the decline of mollusk populations have greatly reduced the production of natural purple dye.</p></div>

        <p>But woah, synthetic dyes?</p>
        <p><br>In 1856, an 18-year-old English chemist, William Henry Perkin, accidentally discovered one of the first synthetic dyes. In search of a treatment for malaria, Perkin experimented with coal tar, a thick, dark liquid by-product of coal-gas production. His experiment failed but left behind an oily residue that stained silk a brilliant purple. He called the dye <span>mauveine.</span></p>

        <p><span>Perkin’s purple</span> changed history. He applied for a patent and abandoned the lab for the path of manufacturing. He paved the way for modern chemistry to move into industrial applications, and indirectly led to advances in modern medicine, explosives, photography, and plastics.</p>

        <p>Perkin’s new purple took the fashion world by storm. First appearing in Paris and London, it quickly spread to America and was heavily featured in popular women's magazines of the day.</p>

        <p>Synthetic dyes became big business after 1860, with Germany in the lead. This BASF dye sample catalog displays the vibrant variety of new synthetic colors. Founded in Germany in 1865 to manufacture dyes, BASF is one of the oldest chemical companies in existence today.</p>
