        <p>Sea snails like these are found around the world. When poked (milked) or crushed, they secrete a substance that was used for making purple dye as early as 1570 BC. Thousands of snails were needed to color a single robe, and for centuries purple dye was more valuable than silver and worn only by royalty.</p>
